# DesertIslandPicks

Description - Based on the common icebreaker question, my project is a website where people can upload their “Desert Island Picks” (the 5 albums, movies, and books that they would choose if they were stranded on a desert island.)

Users can upload their Picks with reviews and comment/like on other users’ Picks. Picks can be clicked on for more information. Explore page offers recommendations and other user's Picks. There is an editable Profile page and the search and Pick components are able to be filtered by media type.

Note:
A few small bugs, mainly in Books section, and some WIP features (and UI to change) but otherwise good to go. Thanks and enjoy:)
